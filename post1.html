                    <h2>Kronos hack will likely affect how employers issue paychecks</h2>

                      A ransomware attack on one of the largest human resources companies may impact how many employees get paid and track their paid time off.

                      Human resources management company Ultimate Kronos Group (known as Kronos) said it suffered a ransomware attack that may keep its systems offline for weeks.
                      
                      To ensure employees are paid, companies that rely on the software are working to find backup plans — including issuing paper checks, some for the first time in years.
                      
                      Kronos is used widely around the U.S. by businesses and governments to track employees' hours and to issue pay. Its many customers include municipal governments, university systems and large corporations. (NPR also uses Kronos.)

                    <p>
                      According to a spokesperson for Kronos, the ransomware attack has affected only customers that use a particular product called the Kronos Private Cloud.

                      "We took immediate action to investigate and mitigate the issue, have alerted our affected customers and informed the authorities, and are working with leading cybersecurity experts. We recognize the seriousness of the issue and have mobilized all available resources to support our customers and are working diligently to restore the affected services," the spokesperson said in a statement to NPR.

                      The extent to which individual employees are affected depends on how their employers used the software.

                      Employers that used Kronos to clock employees in and out of shifts may ask workers to manually track start and end times, while companies that rely on Kronos to issue paychecks may send out paper checks so long as the service is down.
                      
                      Employers may also choose to issue generic paychecks that compensate employees for a baseline number of scheduled hours, rather than the actual hours worked — and later issue corrections as needed.
