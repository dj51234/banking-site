                      "It was illegal when we started," says entrepreneur Lieke van Kerkhoven.

                      She's referring to PharmaSwap, a service which allows Dutch pharmacists to sell medications to one another just as the medicine is about to expire.
                      
                      "European law forbids the selling of medication except when you have a wholesale permit, and pharmacists don't have a wholesale permit," she explains.
                      
                      "But the Dutch health inspectors were sort of allowing it. They saw that if a medicine goes past a certain date it would just be destroyed."
                      
                      In the business world, such a service - or platform as the tech world likes to call them - is novel.
                      
                      While many of us might be comfortable using firms such as Airbnb, the sharing of assets that are lying idle between companies is yet to become mainstream.

                    <p>
                      It is a curious oversight, given the obvious financial advantages.

                      Of course, leasing equipment has long been popular in industries that require expensive kit, like construction.
                      
                      But what we are talking about here - platforms dedicated to sharing assets between firms - is different. Such services promise to use equipment and assets that would otherwise be lying idle.
                      
                      It sounds like an easy win, but such sharing platforms have been slow to take off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One reason is the complexity of working out legal and insurance issues, particularly in highly regulated industries.

                      Organisations may also be unwilling to share with competitors, particularly if owning particular assets is seen as a competitive advantage.
                      
                      This issue isn't confined to just sharing between businesses. The same dynamic is often present between departments of large organisations.
                      
                      "Trust is a major issue," says Ms Van Kerkhoven who co-founded FLOOW2, which set up the PharmaSwap platform and several others.
                      
                      "Departments have a budget, and if I've bought this from my budget, and now I'm giving it to you, how are we going to handle that?" she explains.
                      
                      But she had some success with fashion retailer COS.
                      
                      The fashion retailer created an internal marketplace to share store items such as display furniture, encouraging sharing between their stores in France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg.
                      
                      If one store needed a particular item they could look to see if a nearby store had it before purchasing a new one.
